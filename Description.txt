A library of genetic deseases where i will look up and use any information i can find on the desease.

The information can range from how common the desease is to where in the world the rates are highest.

There will also be a donate tab connected to the companies Iomics or Genetic Networks which do research on genetic desease.

The money donated can be unique to the desease one wants to donate to, allowing for research to be 
spent on more internationally important or personal threats, which is determined by the people.

Even if you do not want to donate, the app should be a library of information that one could access for free for their
own personal or commercial gain, using information found off of the internet and published science papers.
